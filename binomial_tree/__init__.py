"""
Binomial Decision Tree Package
"""

# This file makes the `binomial_tree` directory a Python package.

# We can expose the main classes and functions here for easier access.
# For example, once `tree.py` and `BinomialDecisionTree` are defined:
# from .tree import BinomialDecisionTree
# from .utils import calculate_binomial_log_likelihood, calculate_wilson_score_interval
# from .stopping import should_stop_splitting
# from .splitting import find_best_split

# For now, it can remain relatively empty or just document its purpose.
