# Introduction {.unnumbered}

## Overview

BinomialTree is a specialized decision tree algorithm designed specifically for modeling rare count events with exposure values. Unlike traditional decision trees that split on variance reduction or information gain, BinomialTree optimizes splits by maximizing the binomial likelihood, making it particularly suited for scenarios where:

- The target is a count variable (k) with known exposure (n)
- Events are relatively rare (low success probability)
- The goal is to predict the probability of event occurrence
- The underlying data follows or approximates a binomial distribution

## Key Features

- **Binomial Likelihood Maximization**: Tree splits are chosen to maximize the binomial log-likelihood rather than traditional metrics
- **Statistical Stopping Criteria**: Uses hypothesis testing with Bonferroni correction to determine when to stop splitting, inspired by Conditional Inference Trees (ctree)
- **Exposure-Aware**: Designed to handle count data with varying exposure levels
- **Robust Splitting**: Handles both numerical and categorical features with appropriate split strategies

## Why BinomialTree?

Traditional decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forest or XGBoost are optimized for minimizing squared error or other general loss functions. However, when modeling rare events:

1. **Count/Exposure Structure**: The natural structure of count data with exposure (k successes out of n trials) is better captured by binomial likelihood
2. **Probability Distribution**: For rare events, modeling count/n directly can be problematic due to the poorly behaved probability distribution of ratios
3. **Statistical Rigor**: The hypothesis testing framework reduces overfitting and may reduce the need for train-test splits

## When to Use BinomialTree

BinomialTree performs best when:

- Your target follows or approximates a binomial distribution
- You have count data with exposure information
- Events are relatively rare (p < 0.5, ideally p < 0.1)
- You want interpretable decision boundaries
- Statistical stopping criteria are important for your use case

**Note**: If the binomial distribution assumptions are significantly violated, traditional gradient boosting methods like XGBoost may perform better.

## About This Documentation

This documentation is organized into three main sections:

1. **Theory**: Mathematical foundations, splitting criteria, and stopping conditions
2. **Implementation**: Practical usage guide and API reference  
3. **Performance**: Comparative analysis with XGBoost on various datasets

The examples and comparisons in this documentation demonstrate both the strengths and limitations of the binomial tree approach.

# Mathematical Foundations

## Binomial Distribution Foundation

The BinomialTree algorithm is built on the assumption that the target data follows a binomial distribution. For each observation $i$, we have:

- $k_i$: number of successes (events)
- $n_i$: number of trials (exposure)
- $p_i$: true probability of success (unknown, to be estimated)

The likelihood for observation $i$ under a binomial distribution is:

$$P(k_i | n_i, p) = \binom{n_i}{k_i} p^{k_i} (1-p)^{n_i - k_i}$$

The log-likelihood for observation $i$ is:

$$\ell_i(p) = \log\binom{n_i}{k_i} + k_i \log(p) + (n_i - k_i) \log(1-p)$$

For a set of observations in a node, the total log-likelihood is:

$$\ell_{node}(p) = \sum_{i \in node} \ell_i(p)$$

## Why Model Counts Instead of Rates?

A key insight is that we model the count data directly rather than the rate $k_i/n_i$. This is motivated by several factors:

### Statistical Properties
For rare events where $p$ is small and $n_i$ varies significantly:

1. **Variance Instability**: The variance of $k_i/n_i$ is $p(1-p)/n_i$, which depends on $n_i$
2. **Distribution Shape**: The distribution of $k_i/n_i$ becomes highly skewed and poorly behaved for small $p$ and varying $n_i$
3. **Information Loss**: Converting to rates discards the exposure information that affects uncertainty

### Practical Implications
Consider two observations:

- Observation A: 1 success out of 10 trials ($k/n = 0.1$)  
- Observation B: 10 successes out of 100 trials ($k/n = 0.1$)

Both have the same rate but vastly different uncertainty. The binomial likelihood naturally accounts for this difference through the exposure term.

## Splitting Criteria

### Objective Function
At each node, we seek the split that maximizes the combined log-likelihood of the resulting child nodes:

$$\text{Split Quality} = \ell_{left}(\hat{p}_{left}) + \ell_{right}(\hat{p}_{right}) - \ell_{parent}(\hat{p}_{parent})$$

Where $\hat{p}$ is the maximum likelihood estimate: $\hat{p} = \frac{\sum k_i}{\sum n_i}$

### Numerical Features
For numerical features, we:

1. Sort observations by feature value
2. Consider all possible split points (midpoints between consecutive unique values)
3. For computational efficiency, subsample split points if there are more than `max_numerical_split_points` unique values
4. Handle missing values by always assigning them to the right child

The algorithm efficiently computes split statistics by maintaining cumulative sums as it iterates through sorted values.

### Categorical Features
For categorical features with $C$ categories, we use an optimal grouping strategy:

1. **Sort by Rate**: Order categories by their estimated success rate $\hat{p}_c = \frac{\sum_{i \in c} k_i}{\sum_{i \in c} n_i}$
2. **Optimal Grouping**: Consider all possible ways to split the sorted categories into two groups
3. **Degrees of Freedom**: The split has $df = C - 1$ degrees of freedom for hypothesis testing

This approach is theoretically optimal for binomial data and avoids the exponential complexity of considering all possible category groupings.

## Statistical Stopping Criteria

### Motivation
Traditional decision trees often require external validation or pruning to prevent overfitting. BinomialTree incorporates statistical hypothesis testing directly into the splitting process, inspired by Conditional Inference Trees (ctree).

### Hypothesis Testing Framework
For each potential split, we test:

- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: The split provides no improvement over the parent node
- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: The split provides significant improvement

### Likelihood Ratio Test
For each potential split, we calculate a likelihood ratio test statistic to assess whether the split provides a statistically significant improvement over the parent node.

The test statistic compares the log-likelihood of the data under two models:

- **Null model**: Single binomial distribution for the entire parent node
- **Alternative model**: Separate binomial distributions for left and right child nodes

The likelihood ratio test statistic is:

$$LR = 2(\ell_{children} - \ell_{parent}) = 2[(\ell_{left} + \ell_{right}) - \ell_{parent}]$$

Where:

- $\ell_{parent}$ is the log-likelihood of the parent node with estimated probability $\hat{p}_{parent} = \frac{\sum k_i}{\sum n_i}$
- $\ell_{left}$ is the log-likelihood of the left child with estimated probability $\hat{p}_{left}$
- $\ell_{right}$ is the log-likelihood of the right child with estimated probability $\hat{p}_{right}$

Under the null hypothesis $H_0$ (no benefit from splitting), this test statistic follows a chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom:

- **Numerical features**: $df = 1$ (one additional parameter: the split threshold)
- **Categorical features**: $df = C - 1$ (where $C$ is the number of categories being split)

### Bonferroni Correction
Since we test multiple features at each node, we apply Bonferroni correction:

$$p_{adjusted} = \min(1, p_{raw} \times m)$$

Where $m$ is the number of features tested. The split is considered significant if $p_{adjusted} < \alpha$.

### Implementation Details
The stopping procedure follows these steps:

1. **Pre-split Checks**: Verify minimum sample requirements and maximum depth
2. **Find Best Split**: For each feature, find the split that maximizes log-likelihood gain
3. **Calculate P-values**: Compute likelihood ratio test p-value for each feature's best split
4. **Multiple Testing Correction**: Apply Bonferroni correction to the minimum p-value
5. **Decision**: Split only if adjusted p-value < α

## Comparison to Permutation Testing

The BinomialTree approach differs fundamentally from permutation-based methods like those used in Conditional Inference Trees (ctree):

### Ctree Permutation Approach
Conditional Inference Trees use permutation testing because they make **no assumptions about the target distribution**:

1. Compute observed test statistic for the best split
2. Randomly permute the target values while keeping exposure fixed
3. Recompute test statistic on permuted data
4. Repeat B times (typically B = 1000+) to build null distribution
5. P-value = proportion of permuted statistics ≥ observed statistic

**Advantages of Permutation Testing:**
- No distributional assumptions required
- Exact finite-sample validity
- Robust to any form of model misspecification
- Works for any target distribution

**Computational Cost:**
- Requires B × (number of features) × (split evaluations) calculations
- Typically 1000+ permutations needed for stable p-values
- Computationally expensive for large datasets

### BinomialTree Parametric Approach
BinomialTree leverages the **explicit binomial distribution assumption** to use more efficient inference:

**Key Insight:** Since we assume the target follows a binomial distribution, we can use the known theoretical properties of the likelihood ratio test under this assumption.

**Computational Efficiency:**

- Uses chi-squared distribution for p-value calculation
- Single evaluation per feature (no permutations needed)
- Orders of magnitude faster than permutation testing

**Trade-off:**

- **More efficient** when binomial assumption holds
- **Less robust** when assumption is violated
- **Requires careful validation** of distributional assumptions

This design choice reflects the specialized nature of BinomialTree: by accepting the constraint of binomial-distributed targets, we achieve significant computational efficiency while maintaining statistical rigor through parametric hypothesis testing.

## Assumptions and Limitations

### Key Assumptions
1. **Binomial Distribution**: Target data follows or approximates a binomial distribution
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent conditional on features
3. **Constant Probability**: Within each leaf, the success probability is constant

### When Assumptions Are Violated
- **Overdispersion**: If variance > mean (for count data), consider beta-binomial models
- **Temporal Dependence**: Time-varying probabilities may violate independence
- **Zero-Inflation**: Excess zeros may indicate a different generating process

### Performance Implications
BinomialTree should perform well when assumptions are met but may underperform gradient boosting methods when assumptions are significantly violated. The statistical stopping criteria help prevent overfitting but may also limit the model's ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships.

## Theoretical Advantages

1. **Principled Splitting**: Splits directly optimize the relevant likelihood rather than surrogate measures
2. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Naturally handles varying exposure levels
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Hypothesis testing framework reduces overfitting
4. **Interpretability**: Clear decision boundaries with statistical significance
5. **Reduced Validation Needs**: Statistical stopping may reduce the need for train-test splits

This theoretical foundation guides the practical implementation and helps understand when BinomialTree is likely to excel compared to traditional methods.

# Implementation Guide

## Installation and Dependencies

BinomialTree is implemented in pure Python with minimal dependencies:

```python
# Required dependencies
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd  # Optional, for DataFrame support
```

No external machine learning libraries are required for the core functionality.

## Basic Usage

### Data Preparation

Your data should contain:

- **Target column**: Number of successes (k)
- **Exposure column**: Number of trials (n) 
- **Feature columns**: Predictor variables (numerical or categorical)

```python
# Example data structure
data = [
    {'feature_num': 10.0, 'feature_cat': 'A', 'successes': 2, 'trials': 20},
    {'feature_num': 12.0, 'feature_cat': 'B', 'successes': 8, 'trials': 25},
    {'feature_num': 15.0, 'feature_cat': 'A', 'successes': 3, 'trials': 18},
    # ... more observations
]

# Or as a pandas DataFrame
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

### Basic Model Training

```python
from binomial_tree.tree import BinomialDecisionTree

# Initialize the tree
tree = BinomialDecisionTree(
    min_samples_split=20,
    min_samples_leaf=10, 
    max_depth=5,
    alpha=0.05,
    verbose=True
)

# Fit the model
tree.fit(
    data=data,  # or df for pandas DataFrame
    target_column='successes',
    exposure_column='trials', 
    feature_columns=['feature_num', 'feature_cat']
)

# Make predictions
new_data = [
    {'feature_num': 13.0, 'feature_cat': 'A'},
    {'feature_num': 23.0, 'feature_cat': 'C'}
]
predicted_probabilities = tree.predict_p(new_data)
```

### Inspecting the Model

```python
# Print the tree structure
tree.print_tree()

# Output example:
# Split: feature_num <= 15.500 (p-val=0.0123, gain=12.45) | k=45, n=180 (p̂=0.250)
#   |--L: Split: feature_cat in {'A', 'C'} (p-val=0.0089, gain=8.32) | k=15, n=80 (p̂=0.188)
#   |    |--L: Leaf: k=8, n=50 (p̂=0.160) | Reason: stat_stop
#   |    +--R: Leaf: k=7, n=30 (p̂=0.233) | Reason: min_samples_split
#   +--R: Leaf: k=30, n=100 (p̂=0.300) | Reason: stat_stop
```

## Hyperparameter Configuration

### Core Parameters

```python
tree = BinomialDecisionTree(
    # Structural constraints
    max_depth=5,                    # Maximum tree depth
    min_samples_split=20,           # Min samples to consider splitting
    min_samples_leaf=10,            # Min samples in each leaf
    
    # Statistical stopping
    alpha=0.05,                     # Significance level for splits
    
    # Performance tuning  
    max_numerical_split_points=255, # Limit split points for large features
    
    # Output control
    verbose=False,                  # Enable detailed logging
    confidence_level=0.95           # For confidence intervals (display only)
)
```

### Parameter Guidelines

**`alpha` (Significance Level)**
- Lower values (0.01) create more conservative, smaller trees
- Higher values (0.10) allow more aggressive splitting
- Default 0.05 provides good balance

**`min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf`**
- Increase for rare events to ensure statistical power
- Decrease for abundant data to capture fine patterns
- Rule of thumb: min_samples_leaf ≥ 5-10 expected events

**`max_depth`**
- Acts as a safety constraint
- Statistical stopping often kicks in before max depth
- Set higher when alpha is strict (low)

## Advanced Usage

### Feature Type Specification

```python
# Explicit feature type control
tree.fit(
    data=data,
    target_column='successes',
    exposure_column='trials',
    feature_columns=['numeric_feat', 'categorical_feat'],
    feature_types={
        'numeric_feat': 'numerical',
        'categorical_feat': 'categorical'
    }
)
```

### Missing Value Handling

BinomialTree handles missing values automatically:

**Numerical Features**
- Missing values imputed with median during training
- Same median used for prediction

**Categorical Features**  
- Missing values treated as a distinct category ('__NaN__')
- Unseen categories in prediction mapped to NaN path

```python
# Data with missing values
data_with_missing = [
    {'num_feat': 10.0, 'cat_feat': 'A', 'k': 2, 'n': 20},
    {'num_feat': None, 'cat_feat': 'B', 'k': 8, 'n': 25},  # Missing numeric
    {'num_feat': 15.0, 'cat_feat': None, 'k': 3, 'n': 18}, # Missing categorical
]

# No special handling needed
tree.fit(data=data_with_missing, ...)
```

### Pandas Integration

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Create DataFrame with missing values
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'numeric_feature': [10.0, 12.0, np.nan, 15.0],
    'categorical_feature': ['A', 'B', 'A', None], 
    'successes': [2, 8, 1, 3],
    'trials': [20, 25, 5, 18]
})

# Seamless integration
tree.fit(
    data=df,
    target_column='successes', 
    exposure_column='trials',
    feature_columns=['numeric_feature', 'categorical_feature']
)

# Prediction on new DataFrame
new_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'numeric_feature': [13.0, 23.0],
    'categorical_feature': ['A', 'C']
})
predictions = tree.predict_p(new_df)
```

## Model Interpretation

### Understanding Tree Output

Each node displays comprehensive statistics:

```
Split: feature_name <= threshold (p-val=X.XXXX, gain=XX.XX) | k=XX, n=XXX (p̂=X.XXX) | CI_rel_width=X.XX | LL=XX.XX | N=XXX
```

**Split Information**
- `p-val`: Statistical significance of the split
- `gain`: Log-likelihood improvement from splitting

**Node Statistics**
- `k`: Total successes in node
- `n`: Total trials in node  
- `p̂`: Estimated success probability
- `CI_rel_width`: Relative width of confidence interval
- `LL`: Log-likelihood of the node
- `N`: Number of observations

**Leaf Reasons**
- `stat_stop`: Stopped due to statistical test
- `min_samples_split`: Not enough samples to split
- `max_depth`: Reached maximum depth
- `pure_node`: All observations have same outcome

### Extracting Predictions and Uncertainty

```python
# Get point predictions
probabilities = tree.predict_p(test_data)

# Access detailed node information for uncertainty
def get_prediction_details(tree, data_point):
    """Get prediction with node statistics"""
    # This would require extending the current API
    # Implementation would traverse tree and return node info
    pass
```

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

### Rare Event Modeling

```python
# Configuration for rare events (p < 0.01)
rare_event_tree = BinomialDecisionTree(
    min_samples_split=100,    # Need more samples for stability
    min_samples_leaf=50,      # Ensure adequate events per leaf
    max_depth=6,              # Allow deeper trees
    alpha=0.01,               # More conservative splitting
    verbose=True
)
```

### High-Cardinality Categoricals

```python
# For categorical features with many levels
high_card_tree = BinomialDecisionTree(
    min_samples_split=60,     # Account for category splits
    min_samples_leaf=30,      # Ensure representation per category
    max_depth=6,              # Categories may need more depth
    alpha=0.05
)
```

### Large Dataset Optimization

```python
# For datasets with many unique numerical values
large_data_tree = BinomialDecisionTree(
    max_numerical_split_points=500,  # More split points
    min_samples_split=50,            # Can afford larger minimums
    verbose=False                    # Reduce logging overhead
)
```

## Error Handling and Diagnostics

### Common Issues

**Empty Leaves**
- Increase `min_samples_leaf`
- Check for data quality issues
- Consider feature engineering

**No Splits Found**
- Increase `alpha` to be less strict
- Ensure adequate sample sizes
- Check feature-target relationships

**Performance Issues**
- Reduce `max_numerical_split_points`
- Limit `max_depth`
- Consider feature selection

### Debugging Output

```python
# Enable verbose mode for detailed logging
tree = BinomialDecisionTree(verbose=True)
tree.fit(...)

# Sample verbose output:
# Processing Node abc123 (Depth 0): 1000 samples
#   Evaluating feature 'numeric_feat' (numerical)...
#   Feature 'numeric_feat' best split LL Gain: 23.45, p-value: 0.0012
#   Evaluating feature 'cat_feat' (categorical)...  
#   Feature 'cat_feat' best split LL Gain: 18.32, p-value: 0.0089
#   Overall best split: Feature 'numeric_feat' with p-value: 0.0012
#   Stat Stop Check: Bonferroni-adjusted p-value: 0.0024 < 0.05
#   Node abc123 SPLIT on numeric_feat
```

This implementation guide provides the essential knowledge for effectively using BinomialTree in practice, from basic usage to advanced configurations for specific use cases.

# Performance Analysis

## Comparative Methodology

This chapter presents a comprehensive performance comparison between BinomialTree and XGBoost across various synthetic datasets designed to test different scenarios where binomial tree modeling might excel or struggle.

### Test Framework

The performance evaluation uses a robust testing framework (`test_harness.py`) that:

1. **Generates Synthetic Data**: Creates datasets with known ground truth probabilities
2. **Trains Both Models**: Fits BinomialTree and XGBoost on identical training data
3. **Evaluates Performance**: Uses multiple metrics on held-out test data
4. **Controls for Hyperparameters**: Matches comparable settings where possible

### Evaluation Metrics

**Primary Metrics**
- **RMSE vs Known P**: Root mean squared error against true probability values
- **MAE vs Known P**: Mean absolute error against true probability values  
- **Poisson Deviance**: Measure of count prediction quality

**Secondary Metrics**
- **Log-likelihood**: Model fit on test data
- **Model Complexity**: Number of leaves/estimators, maximum depth

### Target Distribution Assumptions

The synthetic datasets are generated under the assumption that the target follows a binomial distribution with varying:

- Success probabilities (p)
- Exposure levels (n)
- Feature relationships
- Noise levels

**Critical Note**: These comparisons are most meaningful when the binomial assumption holds. Real-world data may violate these assumptions, potentially favoring more flexible methods like XGBoost.

## Scenario Analysis

    "max_depth": 8
}
```

Dataset Size vs Training Time:
- 2K samples:   BinomialTree=0.45s, XGBoost=1.23s
- 10K samples:  BinomialTree=2.13s, XGBoost=3.45s  
- 100K samples: BinomialTree=18.7s, XGBoost=12.4s
```

**Observations**
- BinomialTree faster on small-medium datasets
- XGBoost scales better to very large datasets
- Statistical tests add computational overhead

### Memory Usage

- BinomialTree: Lower memory footprint (single tree)
- XGBoost: Higher memory (ensemble of trees)
- Feature preparation: One-hot encoding increases XGBoost memory

## Practical Recommendations

### Use BinomialTree When:

1. **Domain Knowledge**: You believe data follows binomial distribution
2. **Rare Events**: Modeling low-probability, high-exposure events
3. **Interpretability**: Need to understand and explain model decisions
4. **Limited Data**: Want to avoid overfitting with small samples
5. **Categorical Features**: Have meaningful categorical variables

### Use XGBoost When:

1. **Flexibility Needed**: Uncertain about underlying data distribution
2. **Complex Patterns**: Non-linear relationships and interactions
3. **Performance Priority**: Maximum predictive accuracy is goal
4. **Large Datasets**: Have abundant training data
5. **Standard ML Pipeline**: Want well-established, supported methods

### Hybrid Approach

Consider using both methods:
1. **BinomialTree for EDA**: Understand feature relationships and splits
2. **XGBoost for Production**: Leverage flexibility for final model
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine predictions from both approaches

## Limitations of Analysis

### Synthetic Data Bias
- All test scenarios assume binomial distribution
- Real data may have overdispersion, zero-inflation, or other complications
- Results may not generalize to all real-world scenarios

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- XGBoost configurations not extensively tuned
- BinomialTree tested with predefined configurations
- Optimal settings may differ for specific use cases

### Evaluation Metrics
- Focus on probability prediction accuracy
- Other objectives (ranking, classification) not evaluated
- Business-specific metrics not considered

This performance analysis provides a foundation for understanding when BinomialTree offers advantages over established methods, while acknowledging the scenarios where traditional approaches may be preferable.
